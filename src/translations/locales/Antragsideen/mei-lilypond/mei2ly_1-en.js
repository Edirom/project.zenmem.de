    (2523460,'<p>The more prominent goal of the <code>mei2ly</code> project is the presentation of MEI data, namely producing professional-grade engravings. LilyPond\'s quality of automatic engraving of textually encoded contents is extraordinary, which is the reason why it is the tool of choice for this project. However, it can\'t be expected to produce publication quality without human intervention. The main (and fundamental) advantage of LilyPond over purely graphical solutions like <em>Finale</em> and <em>Sib</em>e<em>lius </em>is<em> </em>that these interventions can be realized in a clean and sustainable manner, with a clear separation of content and presentation. Therefore solutions and user interfaces have to be developed to manage this aspect in the context of Edirom projects.</p><p>Tools and user interfaces will be developed to assist users in fine-tuning the layout of scores rendered with LilyPond. This will work ad-hoc, in order to simply export a one-time rendering of a chosen version of an edition, but it will also be possible to persistently store sets of rendering hints for given situations. A visitor can store his favorite settings for later reuse, and editors can prepare professional engravings for selected readings and/or output targets of an edition.</p><p>This &ldquo;branch&rdquo; of the project is split into two sub-branches, one for the technological foundations to make LilyPond deliver improved scores and one for the actual user interfaces.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"1.2 LilyPond Preparations\" /><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[<= Back (1.2 LilyPond Preparations)]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link> || <ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"2.1 Requirements\" /><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[Next =>]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link></p>',2490866,2),
