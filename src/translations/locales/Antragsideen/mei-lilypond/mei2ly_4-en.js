    (2523296,'<p>MEI and LilyPond are both markup languages but with substantially different approaches. While MEI is a strictly hierarchical XML variant LilyPond\'s input language is targeted at human writable descriptive processing instructions. Therefore the foundation of the project is the implementation of the actual data interchange. It has to be explored to what extent this will be achieved during the actual engraving process and/or through file conversions.</p><p>The main target is enabling LilyPond to directly engrave scores from MEI data, completely circumventing the layer of LilyPond\'s input language and avoiding the need to deal with the inherently different language structures. This will also make it possible to always engrave from up-to-date MEI data that is maintained in one single place. Converting MEI data to native LilyPond files is an additional use case that allows further processing in LilyPond environments (although breaking the link to the original data). However, it can be expected that LilyPond can be asked to do the major part of this task automatically.</p><p>In addition a conversion from LilyPond to MEI should be developed as this makes it possible to import a corpus of existing scores in LilyPond format for MEI editions. Additionally LilyPond can be used as a - semantically enriched - format for primary music input for future MEI editions.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"1 Content / Fundamentals\" /><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[Up]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link> || <ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"1.1.1 Update LilyPond to Guile v2\" /><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[Next =>]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link></p>',2490672,2),
