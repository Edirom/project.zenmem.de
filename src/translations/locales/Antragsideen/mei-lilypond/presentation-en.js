    (2523310,'<p>The <em>Presentation</em> part of <code>mei2ly</code> is clearly the more prominent and visible aspect of the project. Building upon a number of internal improvements work a new user interface module for Edirom Online - the&nbsp;<em>Engrave Preview</em> - will be developed. However, this work will be very modular and most of it can easily be reused by other projects or by LilyPond itself. This part of the project is divided in two branches, one handling the <em>requirements</em>, the other developing the actual <em>user interface.</em></p><p>LilyPond\'s quality of automatic engraving of textually encoded contents is extraordinary, which is the reason why it is the tool of choice for this project. However, it can\'t be expected to produce scores in publication quality <em>completely </em>without human intervention. The main (and fundamental) advantage of LilyPond over purely graphical solutions like <em>Finale</em> and <em>Sib</em>e<em>lius </em>is<em> </em>that these interventions can be realized in a clean and sustainable manner, with clear separation of content and presentation.</p><p>Tools and user interfaces will be developed to assist users in fine-tuning the layout of scores rendered with LilyPond. This will work ad-hoc, in order to simply export a one-time rendering of a chosen version of an edition, but it will also be possible to persistently store sets of rendering hints for given situations. A visitor can store his favorite settings for later reuse, and editors can prepare professional engravings for selected readings and/or output targets of an edition.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"1.2 LilyPond Preparations\" /><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[<= Back (1.2 LilyPond Preparations)]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link> || <ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"2.1 Requirements\" /><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[Next =>]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link></p>',2490692,2),
