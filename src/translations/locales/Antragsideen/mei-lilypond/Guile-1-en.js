Therefore LilyPond relies on Guile.<br /><br />Currently LilyPond still works with Guile 1.8 and not with the current version 2.<br />Making LilyPond work with Guile v2 is crucial for the `mei2ly` project<br />because Guile v2 introduces the `sxml` module providing XML support. This is an<br />important prerequisite for the `mei2ly` (or `ly2mei`) conversion.<br /><br />This process has already been approached and much work already has been done by<br />the LilyPond developers. However, if this isn\'t completed until the `mei2ly`<br />project starts it has to be part of it.</p>',2490722,2),
