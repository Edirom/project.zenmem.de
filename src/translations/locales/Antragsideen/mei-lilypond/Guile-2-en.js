Therefore Guile is a requirement for running and developing LilyPond. Currently LilyPond still works with Guile 1.8 and not with the current version 2. Making LilyPond work with Guile v2 is crucial for the <code>mei2ly</code> project because Guile v2 introduces the <code>sxml</code> module providing XML support. This is an important prerequisite because the actual data conversion between MEI and LilyPond is supposed to take this route.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Type:</strong></td><td><p><em>Prerequisite</em></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Complexity:</strong></td><td>Medium to high, knowledge of Guile and LilyPond\'s architecture (incl. build process) necessary</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Technologies:</strong></td><td colspan=\"1\">Scheme, (C++?)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Dependencies:</strong></td><td>This has to be achieved for the whole branch of format conversions to be possible.
