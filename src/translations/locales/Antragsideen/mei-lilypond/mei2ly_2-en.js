The <em>content</em> has to provide the fundamental compatibility layer between MEI and LilyPond (its language and/or the rendering engine) and a number of (optional) improvements to LilyPond itself. The <em>presentation</em> will have to develop an infrastructure for applying rendering hints to LilyPond scores and finally to create user interface modules to make the tools available in the context of Edirom Online as well as arbitrary other software packages.<br /></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>The hierarchy of pages corresponds to the hierarchy in the project outline.
