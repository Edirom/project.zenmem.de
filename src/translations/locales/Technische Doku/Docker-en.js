Here are some of the things that Docker can deal with:</p><ul><li><p>Creating an application image and replicating it</p></li><li><p>Creating ready to start applications that are easily distributable</p></li><li><p>Allowing easy and fast scalation of instances</p></li><li><p>Testing out applications and disposing them afterwards</p></li></ul><p>The idea behind Docker is to create <strong>portable lightweight</strong> <strong>containers for software applications </strong>that can be run on any machine with Docker installed, regardless of the underlying OS.</p><p>In short, the plan is to integrate docker into our deployment process (continuous delivery concept). It benefits both development teams and for release phase as well.</p><p>For docker installation please refer to this link:</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/\">https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/</a></p><p>Cross check if the installation was successful.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Following instructions are for development team:</u></p><p>In general, docker administrator writes a Dockerfile for a project and users can build an image for this project using this file. From this image, users can run the application in a container. So, to do all these activities we need to know some docker terms. The following article is just for reference and it gives lot of information , we don\'t need all of them as of now.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-getting-started\">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-getting-started</a></p><p>For example consider zenmem-ng2-seed project:</p><p>1) Install docker and check if its working.</p><p>2) Clone zenmem-ng2-seed project from our bitbucket and checkout to develop branch.</p><p>3) Here you must be already having the Dockerfile</p><p>4) Now build the image. ( docker build -t image_name . ). Read a bit online about docker build command and its arguments.</p><p>5) It takes time to build the image. Once the build is successful, it generates an image id. Use this image id or image name to run the image in a container. (docker run &ndash;net=host image_name or imageid). Read a bit online about docker run command and its arguments.</p><p>6) Now you can access the application at generated urls.</p><p><u>For others other than development team.</u></p><p>The image would be already built by administrator or development team and stored in docker hub. The user just needs to pull it from the hub and run the image. Read a bit online about docker pull command and its arguments.</p>',4325379,2),
